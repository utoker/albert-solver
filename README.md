## About The Project

This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for expert assistance with essays and homework using cutting-edge AI technology, powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The AI model is integrated with a web application built using modern web technologies such as TypeScript, Next.js, NextAuth.js, NextUI, Prisma, SWR, React and Stripe for handling paid subscriptions.

Users can also upgrade to a pro subscription for additional features, and Stripe is used to handle the subscription payments.
